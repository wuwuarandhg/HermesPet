HermesPet is an AI chat client + desktop companion that lives **right below your MacBook's notch**.

**The most important thing**: it works out of the box. No CLI tools required on your machine. Open it → pick an AI provider (DeepSeek / Zhipu / Kimi / MiniMax / OpenAI / OpenClaw / your own cloud gateway) → paste an API Key → start chatting. If you also have `claude` / `codex` CLIs installed, the app auto-detects them and unlocks advanced capabilities like "read/write local files / run commands / generate images".

Tap the notch to summon the chat window, hold `⌘⇧V` to talk, drop files onto the little pet, watch fomo the nine-tailed fox wander your desktop, see the Dynamic Island draw a Face ID-style checkmark ✓ when the AI is done — **desktop AI should feel alive**. The entire interface now ships in **English / 中文 with instant in-app switching**.

> Swift 6 · SwiftUI · macOS 14+ · Pure native (no Electron / no Web view) · Apache-2.0 open source

---

## ✨ Highlights

### 🔀 5 AI engines, truly running in parallel

Not switching — **truly in parallel**. Each conversation independently binds to one AI engine and locks after the first message. Run up to 8 conversations at once (`⌘1`~`⌘8` jumps instantly). Have Claude editing code, Online AI translating docs, and Codex generating an image — **all at the same time**. When a background conversation finishes, the corresponding spot on the Dynamic Island pulses softly so you don't have to babysit.

| Engine | Best for | Setup |
|---|---|---|
| ☁️ **Online AI** ⭐ | DeepSeek / Zhipu / Kimi / MiniMax / OpenAI — just pick a provider and paste a Key | DMG ships with bundled opencode runtime, **zero dependencies** |
| ⚡ **OpenClaw** | Gateway-style AI platform on your network | Install [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai) (one-line npm) → auto-detect + zero-config first connect |
| ✦ **Hermes Gateway** | Any **OpenAI-compatible HTTP endpoint** (self-hosted / cloud / vLLM / Ollama) | Fill in baseURL + Key; 3 built-in presets, model auto-pulled from `/v1/models` |
| ⌨️ **Claude Code** | File edits / shell commands / deep coding | Install [`claude` CLI](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/claude-code/overview) (optional) |
| ✨ **Codex** | Code + native image generation (multi-image vision) | Install [`codex` CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex) (optional) |

**New users see only "Online AI" mode by default** (the simplest experience); the other four modes **auto-appear and unlock** when the matching tool is installed — no manual toggling required. **User intent always wins over auto-detection** — any enabled mode can be turned off again in settings.

### 🦊 5 pixel pets · one per AI mode

Every AI mode gets its own **pixel-art pet** living in your menu bar:

| Pet | Mode | Vibe |
|---|---|---|
| 🦞 **Clawd** | Claude Code | Orange pixel crab, the OG — wanders the desktop sniffing your icons |
| ☁️ **Cloud** | Online AI | Indigo sprite, puts on glasses when you drop an image to inspect |
| 🦊 **fomo** | OpenClaw | Moonlight silver-white nine-tailed fox, with twitchy ears |
| 🐴 **Pegasus** | Hermes | Golden flying horse, mane fluttering in trot rhythm |
| ⌨️ **coco** | Codex | Iron Man-style pixel robot |

Pets aren't just decoration:

- 🍽 **Drop a file on the pet** → it chews and swallows → file auto-attaches to the current conversation
- 👃 **Drag the pet onto a desktop icon** → it stops and sniffs → AI generates a ≤10-character quip about the filename
- 🌀 **Cross-island teleport portal**: when the pet walks under the notch, a **pixel-art teleport portal** appears (octagonal frame + rotating star points + mode-color pulse) and the pet warps to the other side
- 🛡 Filenames pass through a local blocklist before reaching the AI (salary / contract / password / `.env` etc. are dropped)

### 🏔 Dynamic Island = OS-level status display (incl. tool permission)

The capsule below the notch is the **heart** of HermesPet:

- **Left ear** sprite follows the current mode in real time (5 independent animations)
- **Right ear** real-time tool status: rotating pulse → step count → file change count → **Face ID-style stroke checkmark ✓** on completion
- **Hover → water-drop expansion** — the capsule flows down from the notch, showing mode color + model name + recent reply preview
- 🛡 **Real-time tool permission**: when Claude / Codex wants to **write a file or run a command** on your machine, a black card pops out **flush below** the island (visually seamless with the notch), showing the tool name + key arguments, with three buttons **[Deny / Allow / Always Allow]** and a feedback banner after you decide. When the chat window is open, the UI hops into the header strip and the pet strikes an "arms-up, help-me" pose — **HermesPet won't decide for you**
- 💬 **AI response summary card**: when the chat window is closed, a summary card pops below the island for 8s after the AI finishes — never miss a reply you weren't watching for
- 🎙 **Live speech transcription**: hold `⌘⇧V` and a real-time transcript bar appears below the island
- ❌ **Error state** turns the whole capsule amber + click to retry · 📸 **Screenshot shutter** 0.18s white flash · 🌊 **Background conversations** pulse softly on their capsule spot

### 🎙 Push-to-talk · 📎 Drag files · 💬 Multi-conversation

**Push-to-talk from any app (`⌘⇧V`)**: an **Apple Intelligence-style colorful glow** appears at the screen edge + the right ear pulses a red microphone + a live transcript shows below the island. Speech uses **SFSpeechRecognizer** (macOS offline model); release to auto-send, with a "ding" when the AI finishes.

**Drag files to AI · AI reads them on demand**: instead of stuffing the whole PDF into context, HermesPet appends the **absolute path** to the prompt and lets Claude / Codex **read just the pages they need** with their own Read / Bash tools — saving context, tokens, and time. Images support four input paths: **clipboard paste / drag / `⌘⇧J` screenshot / Codex direct generation**.

**Multi-conversation · cross-AI shared context (signature feature)**: up to **8 conversations** at once (`⌘N` new / `⌘[` `⌘]` switch / `⌘1`~`⌘8` jump), each independently bound to a mode with zero cross-contamination; **switching a conversation's mode passes the entire history to the new model** — Claude can keep going from what Hermes was discussing, and vice versa.

### 📋 AI task planner & dispatch · 📰 Cross-day memory + daily companion

Let the AI **plan tasks and dispatch them to the right AI**: say "help me list what to do today" and the AI replies with a ```` ```tasks ```` YAML block that the client renders into **actionable cards**, each with 3 buttons — 📌 **Pin** to the desktop (checkbox strikes through, never disappears) / 🤖 **Let AI do it** (auto-creates a conversation in the recommended mode) / ✗ **Skip**. Not just a chat client — a **task dispatch hub**.

It also **quietly remembers you** (a big step in v1.2.13): it records what apps you used, files you dropped, and what you asked the AI (all in local SQLite, sensitive keywords stripped at the source), then gently checks in at the right moments:

- 🌅 **Daily briefing**: on morning launch the AI reviews yesterday, writes a Markdown recap, and **follows up proactively** ("You were tuning SwiftUI animation yesterday — want me to Pin the key solution to your desktop?")
- 🎉 **Weekly review + milestones**: a recap every week, plus a little celebration at 30 / 100 / 365 days together
- 🧠 **Cross-mode shared memory**: one **user-editable memory shared across all 5 AIs**, so any engine you switch to still "gets you" (edit / clear / disable under Settings → Privacy)

> All intent data **stays on your machine** — one-click export to JSON / clear / blocklist an app.

### 🌐 Bilingual UI (new in v1.2.13) · 🔄 Auto-update · 🛡 Anti-piracy

- 🌐 **Full bilingual interface**: switch between **中文 / English** in settings — **instant, no restart**; even the AI's chat replies **follow the language you pick**; new users choose their language on first launch
- 🔄 **In-app auto-update**: 60s after launch + every 24h checks GitHub Release; new version → 🔵 indicator in the menu bar → "Download & Install" fetches the DMG, mounts it, and Finder prompts you (**no Sparkle, no telemetry**)
- 🛡 **Official version verification**: Settings → About → one-click codesign check; authentic build shows Team ID `R34KL4X4D9` (defeats third-party repackaging)
- 🚨 **One-click crash reporting**: scans local crash logs → copies the full log to clipboard + opens the GitHub Issue page (**zero backend, zero privacy concerns**)

### 🎨 And a pile of nice little details

Full **Markdown** render (GFM tables + numbered lists → clickable cards + code blocks with "copied" feedback) · **Pin** any AI reply to the desktop · **Quick-ask, redesigned (v1.2.14)** (`⌘⇧Space`, Spotlight-style) without opening the chat window — now with an iOS 26 liquid-glass look, and you can **select any screen region to OCR its text** for the AI · **paste images straight into chat** · **context-usage bar** so you always know how much room is left this turn · **input bar strictly follows Apple HIG** (Capsule + iMessage feel) · **5 chat font sizes** (`⌘+` / `⌘-` / `⌘0`) · **window pinning toggle** · **optional Dock icon** (defaults to menubar-agent style) · **5 event sounds** each togglable + custom audio drop-in.

## 🚀 Quick start

### Option A: Download the DMG (recommended, no Xcode needed · 3 min to first chat)

1. Go to the [Releases page](https://github.com/basionwang-bot/HermesPet/releases) and download the latest DMG (**Apple Silicon / Intel** — pick the one for your chip; unsure? click  → About This Mac and check the "Chip" line)
2. Double-click the DMG → drag "Hermes 桌宠" into Applications
3. **Open it from Launchpad / Spotlight with a double-click** — it's Apple-notarized, so Gatekeeper won't block it
4. Click the menu-bar icon → gear ⚙️ → AI Backend → **pick a provider from the dropdown** → paste API Key → start chatting

No API Key yet? Each provider in the settings panel has a **"Get Key" link** that goes straight to its official signup page.

### Option B: Build from source (developers)

Requires macOS 14+ and Xcode Command Line Tools:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/basionwang-bot/HermesPet.git
cd HermesPet
./install.sh
```

| Script | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `./build.sh` | Just build `.app` into `./HermesPet.app` |
| `./install.sh` | Build + install to `/Applications` + launch (**use this daily**) |
| `./make-dmg.sh` | Generate a distributable DMG (Developer ID signed + Apple-notarized, double-click opens) |

> All three scripts sign with a **Developer ID certificate + Hardened Runtime** (when a certificate is present), keeping TCC permissions stable — "what you install locally == what users download".

### Advanced: unlock more AI engines (all optional)

All four advanced engines are **optional**. Installing them unlocks stronger capabilities; you can fully use the Online AI mode without any of them:

| Engine | Install command | Unlocks |
|---|---|---|
| **OpenClaw** | `npm i -g openclaw@latest && openclaw onboard --install-daemon` | Gateway-style AI platform + multi-model aggregation |
| **Hermes Gateway** | Self-host any OpenAI-compatible API (or fill in a cloud baseURL) | Connect to your company's internal LLM / vLLM / Ollama |
| **Claude Code** | [Official installation guide](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/claude-code/overview) | File read/write + shell commands + deep coding |
| **OpenAI Codex** | [Official repository](https://github.com/openai/codex) | Image generation + multi-image vision + code |

After installing, **restart HermesPet and the path is auto-detected** (on launch it runs `zsh -lic 'command -v ...'`, reading your real `PATH` from `~/.zshrc`). If detection fails, open settings and click "Re-detect" on the corresponding mode's card.

### First-time permissions

| Permission | Trigger | Used for |
|---|---|---|
| Screen Recording | First `⌘⇧J` screenshot | ScreenCaptureKit |
| Microphone + Speech Recognition | First `⌘⇧V` | Recording + SFSpeechRecognizer |
| Accessibility | Quick Ask reads selected text | AX API |
| Finder Automation | Enable "Clawd desktop patrol" | osascript reads desktop icons |

After granting any permission, **fully quit and reopen** (menu-bar icon → Quit → reopen) so the new process picks it up.

## 🎯 Online AI: 6 providers out of the box

"Online AI" is the default, zero-dependency mode for new users. It ships with presets for 6 mainstream LLMs, each with a **3-level response preference** (fast / balanced / deep) auto-mapped to the right model; the bundled opencode runtime handles SSE / reasoning filtering / tool calling:

| Provider | Default model | Sign up |
|---|---|---|
| DeepSeek | deepseek-chat | [platform.deepseek.com](https://platform.deepseek.com) |
| Zhipu GLM | glm-4-flash | [open.bigmodel.cn](https://open.bigmodel.cn) |
| Moonshot Kimi | moonshot-v1-8k | [platform.moonshot.cn](https://platform.moonshot.cn) |
| MiniMax | MiniMax-M2.7 | [platform.minimaxi.com](https://platform.minimaxi.com) |
| OpenAI | gpt-4o-mini | [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com) |
| Custom | You decide | Any OpenAI-compatible endpoint |

Each provider's **API Key is stored separately** (no cross-contamination); switching auto-fills the matching baseURL. **All 5 modes' configs are stored fully independently**, new conversations inherit "the last mode you used", and you're **5 minutes from install to first chat**.

---

## ⌨️ Keyboard shortcuts

**Global hotkeys** (trigger from any app):

| Combo | Function |
|---|---|
| `⌘⇧H` | Show / hide chat window |
| `⌘⇧J` | Capture current screen and attach to chat |
| `⌘⇧V` | Hold to talk, release to auto-send |
| `⌘⇧P` | Pin the latest AI reply of the current conversation to the desktop |
| `⌘⇧Space` | Spotlight-style quick-ask floating window |

**In-window** (when the chat window is focused): `⌘N` new conversation · `⌘[` / `⌘]` previous/next conversation · `⌘1`~`⌘8` jump to that conversation · `⌘⌫` close current conversation · `⌘+` / `⌘-` / `⌘0` font size.

---

## 🗂 Data storage / Privacy

| Path | Contents |
|---|---|
| `~/.hermespet/conversations.json` | All conversation history (without image Data) |
| `~/.hermespet/images/` | User-attached / Codex-generated image persistence |
| `~/.hermespet/pins.json` | Desktop Pin cards |
| `~/.hermespet/activity.sqlite` | Activity sampling + user intent records (briefing / memory source) |
| `~/Library/Caches/HermesPet/` | Screenshot temp area + pet temp cache |

**Privacy boundary** (HermesPet makes "no data collection" a hard constraint):

- 🛡 **Zero telemetry**: the project itself does NOT phone home. All AI calls go to backends you configure yourself (your API Key / your self-hosted Gateway / your local CLI)
- 🛡 **Desktop patrol blocklist**: filenames pass through a local blocklist before reaching the AI (salary / contract / password / `.env` / `credentials` keywords are dropped entirely)
- 🛡 **Activity sampling + shared memory stay local**: all briefing / memory data lives in local SQLite and **never leaves your machine**; one-click export to JSON / clear / blocklist an app / edit or disable shared memory
- 🛡 **Crash logs**: HermesPet scans local crash files → copies the full log to clipboard → **you** manually paste into a GitHub Issue. It never auto-uploads anything.

> Technical decision notes (gotchas / Swift 6 isolation / macOS layout cycles) live in [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md); roadmap in [TODO.md](./TODO.md). ~60 Swift files, pure native, no Electron.
